As a user, I want to browse a list of posts, sortable by ascending or descending order (was unable to do the latter due to time constraints).
As a user, I was to be able to click on a post to read the full message. I also want to be able to comment on an individual post.

This was a big step up. I struggled to get my head around the fact that I was seeding a database on Vercel, and then writing the code to add data to the database from the UI. But I got there! I seeded the database with content from ChatGPT so that I could fill out the page quickly - and a simple blog I have made. I hope to be able to add to this in future, making the UI a bit prettier etc. I found there was not a huge amount of help online but the tutors at Tech Ed have been so helpful, especially when I have felt a little demotivated this week.

I felt the stretch goals were beyond my capabilities, but I am pleased with what I have been able to produce in 4 days of learning.
